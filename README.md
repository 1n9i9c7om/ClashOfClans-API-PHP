# ClashOfClans-API-PHP

This is a wrapper for SuperCell's official Clash Of Clans-API located at https://developer.clashofclans.com/#/

Before trying to use this, you have to create an account and request a token on their website. After that, **change the token** located in the **API.class.php** to yours.

I'm working on the documentation, for now, you have to figure out how to use it for yourself. 
There's an example in the repository, though.

Live-Demo of example: http://1n9i9c7om.com/coc/test.php
Keep in mind I'm not a web designer, this page is just to show how this wrapper works.
